# Dynamsoft Core Module

The Dynamsoft Core module lays the foundation for Dynamsoft SDKs based on the [DCV (Dynamsoft Capture Vision) architecture](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/). It encapsulates the basic classes, interfaces, and enumerations shared by these SDKs.
