# Dynamsoft Utility Module

The Dynamsoft Utility module defines auxiliary classes, including the ImageManager, and implementations of the CRF (Captured Result Filter). These are shared by all Dynamsoft SDKs based on the [Dynamsoft Capture Vision architecture](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/).
